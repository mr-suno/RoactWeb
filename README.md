# RoactWeb DEV Build
A development, possibly unstable version of RoactWeb.
- **Head to the main branch [here](https://github.com/mr-suno/RoactWeb).**

> [!WARNING]
> This project **cannot be used in Roblox Studio**, because `game:HttpGet()` is an exploit function on the `game` metatable.

### Usage ðŸ”—
```lua
local Roact = loadstring(game:HttpGet(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-suno/RoactWeb/refs/heads/dev/RoactWeb.lua"
))()

-- ... Use Roact as you'd normally would.
```
